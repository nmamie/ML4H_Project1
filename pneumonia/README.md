# ML for Healthcare Project 1 Task 2: Pneumonia Prediction Dataset

## Description
We train CNNs for early detection of the pneumonia disease in patients. We used the public [Pneumonia Chest X-Ray Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle. Through the model's post processing methods used for explainability, we try to give insight into how the model makes its predictions and what features were important. This is important to build trust between clinicians and models, so that they can be used in practice.

## Installation
You can simply install the dependencies through [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

```
cd pneumonia
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Code

Our code is stored in `ML4H_Project1_Task2.ipynb`, so make sure you have the required setup to run such notebooks. We provide outputs already, so you don't have to train the models anew. However if you decide to do so run all cells to ensure reproducibility of the results. Jupyter provides an option for that at the top of the notebook.

`Run All`
