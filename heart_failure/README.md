# ML for Healthcare Project 1 Task 1: Coronary Heart Disease

## Description
We train ML models (LASSO, tree, MLP, NAM) for early detection of potential coronary heart diseases. We used the public [Heart Disease](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset) dataset from Kaggle. Through the model's inherent interpretability or post processing methods used for explainability, we try to give insight into how the models made their predictions/what features were important. This is important to build trust between clinicians and models, so that they can be used in practice.

## Installation
You can simply install the dependencies through [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

```
cd heart_failure
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Code

Our code is stored in `ML4H_Project1_Task1.ipynb`, so make sure you have the required setup to run such notebooks. We provide outputs already, so you don't have to train the models anew. However if you decide to do so run all cells to ensure reproducibility of the results. Jupyter provides an option for that at the top of the notebook.

`Run All`
